For New Year's Eve 2012 some friends and me built a launch pad for
rockets. We have used a Raspberry Pi for controlling the launching.

The Raspberry Pi had a webinterface. On this website, we could launch
rockets by clicking the right bomb button. The Raspberry Pi then 
used a relay to power one of five cigarette lighters.

The circuit diagram is made with gSchem from gEDA 
(http://geda-project.org/).
